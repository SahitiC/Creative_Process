problems with running and reproducing analyses:

1. Geneva font not available
2. k-mean clusters order don't match headings
3. percentages of participant and LLM assignments to clusters don't match those in paper Fig 3
4. elbow plots for k-means clusters of jump profiles missing 
5. cluster assignment ~ temp coeff missing for VFT in regression result

correctness:

i only skimmed some important functions and as far as i understood them, they look good  


readability and understandability:

1. say AUT brick or paperclip or VFT animals intead of tasks 1, 2, 3
2. y-axis label missing for validity: AUT vs VF jumping plots


analysis

1. why were LLM jump profiles not clustered themselves, instead of assigning to human clusters?
2. why not iterate k-means algorithm multiple times? (n_init parameter in scipy function)
3. how were cut-offs for semantic sim set (like 0.7 for distance threshold or 0.8 for jumps?)
